Years ago, I hired a PM who messaged me on LinkedIn. They were direct, to the point, and concise. Here’s the message:

"Hi Adam, I hope you're well. I wanted to learn more about the mid-level PM role you posted about. I'm currently a _____ with _____ years of PM experience in the tech industry; including roles at _______ and ________. I’m looking to continue my career in the PM space. I’m passionate about ______ and I’d love the opportunity to show you how I can create value for your health technology team, just like I delivered this project (insert hyperlink) for my last employer. I hope to hear from you soon and am happy to provide a resume! Thank you."

*Disclaimer - I had posted about an open role in my team the week before.

In my opinion, there's no perfect LinkedIn intro,

and much depends on the audience.

However, this is a solid example of how to be clear, concise, direct, and friendly all at the same time.

No, "How are you?" to start the convo.

No "virtual coffee"

No “picking my brain"

No asking strangers to do chores for you.

Also, since I’m more active on LinkedIn, often getting upwards of 25-30 messages a week, I appreciated that I didn’t have to read multiple paragraphs.

Sometimes the right message is all it takes.

Let me know what intros have worked for you!
